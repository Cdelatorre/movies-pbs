TEST•
. types correctly each component
. styled viewed movies
• Show a loader when adding a movie or deleting a movie or searching for a movie.
The delay should be 3 seconds.
• If go to route like /genre=romance, it should redirect me to a new page which
should show the loader for 3 seconds and then only movies which have that genre.
Extra points:-
• Add an edit button in the movie list. Clicking on the button should turn the movie
name into an input tag with the movie name in it and also show a save button.
Which user can then edit and save.

Note:-
• We know that the actions performed in this app are not async. So we would like you
to implement your own async logic. You can use setTimeouts, setIntervals, Promises,
sagas, thunk etc.
• Your design must be mobile first and reponsive. 2. Add testing in above mentioned app using Jest and
React Testing Library.
To do:-
• Add at least one test for each of your component and screen.
• Each test should shallow render your component and must have at least two
assertions about your component.
• Make sure your assertions are relevant to the logic of application. For example:-
buttons should have a click assertion which performs some function.
• Add three negative tests of your choosing.
• There should be at least one test which tests the async logic of the that component
(We would like to see how you test async logic and handle mocks).
Things to keep in mind:-
• Please lint and format your code.
• Your code should be modular and re-usable.
• When we run the code in development mode; make sure your code doesn't have
warnings or errors in browser console.
• Code should be properly documented and easier to understand.
• Style your buttons and inputs and tables using your own css and not any
framework.
• Your design must be mobile first and reponsive.
• When you submit your code let us know which extra points features you have
completed.
• Please add your code on github and make commits so we can review the code.
